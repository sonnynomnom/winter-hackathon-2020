# JavaScript Arrays

Arrays are lists of ordered, stored data. They can hold items that are of any data type. Arrays are created by using square brackets, with individual elements separated by commas.

```js
// An array containing numbers
const numberArray = [0, 1, 2, 3];
 
// An array containing different data types
const mixedArray = [1, 'chicken', false];
```
