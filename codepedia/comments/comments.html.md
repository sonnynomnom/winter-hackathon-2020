# Comments in HTML

In HTML, comments can be added between an opening `<!--` and closing `-->`. Content inside of comments will not be rendered by browsers, and are usually used to describe a part of code or provide other details.

Comments can span single or multiple lines.

```html
<!-- Main site content -->
<div>Content</div>
 
<!--
  Comments can be 
  multiple lines long.
-->
```
