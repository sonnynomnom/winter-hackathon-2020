# HTML Elements

An HTML element is a piece of content in an HTML document and uses the following syntax:

* opening tag
* content
* closing tag

```html
<p>Hello World!</p>
```

In the code above:
* `<p>` is the opening tag.
* `Hello World!` is the content.
* `</p>` is the closing tag.

## Nested HTML Elements

HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements (`<html>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>`):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Title!</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph!</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
