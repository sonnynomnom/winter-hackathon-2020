# HTML Attributes

HTML attributes are values added to the opening tag of an element to configure the element or change the element’s default behavior. 

In the provided example, we are giving the `<p>` paragraph` element a unique identifier using the `id` attribute and changing the color of the default text using the style attribute.

```html
<p id="my-paragraph" style="color: green;">Here’s some text for a paragraph that is being altered by HTML attributes</p>
```
